# Toontown Rewritten Keep Alive

This project is a proof-of-concept that a keep alive can be made for Toontown Rewritten.

## Notice
I am not liable for any actions taken against your account as a result of using this program.
This was created simply to prove that a new keep alive could easily be made, but please do not abuse this. There is no reason to have 'parker toons' anyways.

## About
This script was coded using AutoHotKey. For your convenience, an exe download has been provided in the releases section. If you're paranoid however, you can compile the script yourself.
At this time, this only works for Windows operating systems.

*Proven to work on Windows 7 SP1, 64-bit edition*
